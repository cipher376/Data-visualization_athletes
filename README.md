Question under study What type of sport is mostly influence by sex, age, height and weight? 
My research is to understand the contributions of sex (gender), age, height and weight to the various sporting events. 
This may easily answer question like “Does weight influence the winning of tag-of-war sport?”. 
This visualization will be done python libraries panda, matplotlib, plotly, numpy, seaborn and Scikitlearn

Data pre-processing
Most of the data give are clean except for age, height and weight. The age fields have about 9474 null
values, the height field has 60171 null values and weight has about 62875 null values. These data are too
much to ignore so I filled in these null values with the average of the provided data. Thus if age is not
provided, I then average the provided ages and use that to replace the missing data.
Feature Average
Age 25.56
Height 175.34
Weight 70.70
